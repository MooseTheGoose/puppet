# puppet
DSL with similar syntax to Javascript for use with WebDriver.

# External Dependencies
Puppet has the following libraries as external dependencies.

* MPIR
* libcurl

vcpkg and MSBuild are used to resolve these at the moment.

# TODO

* Actually learn build systems or introduce separate platform
  folders so that build process goes smoothly

* Try to talk to drivers using HTTP

* There are some times I use C headers. Switch to C++ headers
  and replace C functions with std::<function name>
